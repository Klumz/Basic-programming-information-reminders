In my Agile essay, I will be discussing about how running daily stand-ups in virtual office settings - such as Slack - 
influences time-boxing and team productivity. 

I will go in depth about how virtual tools such as Slack, among others, go in conjunction with time management both for small and 
complex projects, as well as the potential impact they can evoke on team productivity.

The major reason to why I have chosen to explore this specific topic is due to the fact that I have a fair amount of experience when it 
comes to using Slack for daily stand-ups, even more so when it comes to time management, like when or what to prioritize in a 
project in order to fit and deliver everything before or at least the deadline which I will be covering. Team productivity also applies here, 
as it eventually becomes very apparent how much influence it receives, which is also based on my personal experience. 

Virtual tools are especially relevant for work practice as it can either increase or maybe even decrease team productivity depending on the person. 
For example, I feel it is considerably easier for introverts to engage themselves in virtual offices compared to talking face to face
in actual meetings, which could cause them to shy away the more people there are in the meeting which in the long run 
could decrease both time management and team productivity.
